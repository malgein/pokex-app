It is a project that uses several tools that in my opinion make react great, among them the use of components, hooks, use context.

all with a pokemon theme in which the user when entering the app will be able to see a list in the form of a primer of several pokemons, there he will be able to see in addition to their names, the type, their number in the pokedex, and a front illustrative image .

The use of components within components and then passing them to the main app file and the fact that one of them contains a functionality where you can search for the pokemon of your choice just by typing its name and clicking search, make it one of my favorites. favorite projects

Perhaps the most striking in my opinion that in addition to all this mentioned above, this app also makes calls to the pokemon api from which it extracts all this data live and through react js skills we can mold and illustrate them in this simple but beautiful application.

Do not forget also that you can give a like to the pokemon that you like and that adding more to the list of tools used in the project we must add the use of local storage so your hearts to a specific pokemon will not be deleted even if you leave the page or refresh it.

I think in the future to add more structure and functionality such as the fact that you can select any pokemon and through an entry to a segment of the page obtain more information about the pokemon in a larger primer format and with information such as the amount of attack, defense , speed among others.

A simple project but loved by me that illustrates in an almost deep way the knowledge of react js.
